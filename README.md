# lua-HMM
A proof-of-concept n-order Hidden Markov Model with Viterbi decoding, implemented in Lua

test.lua demonstrates the functionality: it loads a file describing an HMM, emits 1000 symbols, then decodes the emitted symbols using the Viterbi algorithm

A first-order and second-order example file are in the examples folder
